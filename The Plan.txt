We begin by standardizing our crash data to be easily managed.

Our end goal is the following:
    "What is the probability that Road A has a crash on it within the next hour?"

To do this we will be using input data that looks like:
    Crashes on Road A in last 10  years
    Crashes on Road A in last 5 years
    Crashes on Road A in last year
    Crashes on Road A in last month
    Crashes on Road A in week prior
    Crashes on Road A yesterday
    Road A Geometry
    Road A Speeds
    Road A Suburb
    Road A Node Type
    Road A Hour

Which means we have to train the model on data the looks like:
    Historical crashes [as segmented above]
    Road geometry
    Road speeds
    Road suburb
    Road note type
    Road hour
    Whether or not there was a crash on the road during that hour.

We would then have to weight our model extremely heavily towards predicting crashes.
